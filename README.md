# RobotRemoteControl Year:2016
> Controlling 4 wheel differentially driven robot and components on it using PS2 remote

* Robot has Â 4 DC motors controlled drive, Ultrasonic ping sensor for obstacle avoidance and a bldc motor on a linear verticle actuator
* Code is compiled and uploaded on an ATmega2560 microcontroller
* The robot has a power screw controlled pole climbing mechanism

Code from 2016 written for a robotics competition: ABU Robocon 2016
